Observations
The overwhelming majority of players, over 84%, are Male. The majority of purchases are coming from users between the ages of 20-24, followed by 15-19. With this in mind, it would be more profitable and appeal to a larger audience base to both market and create more items that would appeal to this crowd of high school to college aged males.

A majority of players tend to only buy one item. While this falls in line with industry standards, the majority of purchases coming from a small pool of people, creating some more general appeal items, or "cheaper" versions of more popular items, may encourage people to make a second purchase.

Of the top 5 profitable items, only 1 was under 4 dollars in price. Consider making more "premium" items that will draw a lot of attention of a larger majority of the player base, as these items will likely see quite a few purchases.
